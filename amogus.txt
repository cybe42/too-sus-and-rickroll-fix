⠀⠀
Once upon a time, there was an amogus who lived in civilization, and loved the city of civilization, but at the same time wanted to love the wild too.
So the amogus decided to become sus and hide his intentions.
He sneaked behind the king AND HE PULLED OUT A SUS KNIFE.
Everyone heard it, amogus has murdered the crewmate king and now everyone was panicking.
Everyone was looking for the amogus, but the amogus was hiding in the bushes.
The people who didn’t die by the amogus’ knife were still looking for him and began to search for him.
But the amogus was running away with his lover and her children.
The people were still searching, but the amogus was on a horse and he and his lover and her children were on a horse.
The people ran after them, but the amogus and his lover were riding faster than them.
They were now in the forest, so the people couldn’t find them, but they kept on trying.
The people were still running and they were getting tired.
But the amogus and his lover were riding faster than them and they were now in a lake, so the people couldn’t find them, but they kept on trying.
The people were getting tired and they were getting frustrated.
But the amogus and his lover were still riding faster than them, and they were now in a cave, so the people couldn’t find them, but they kept on trying.
Amogus, with a burning anger inside him, told his lover he will die for what he believes in. And before his lover could say anything Amogus pulled out Newcon Optik NVS 15-MAGBW Autogated Gen 3 Night Vision Goggles and a 12 Inch blade and he started running in the dark furiously.
All you could hear was the screams of tens of crewmates. Amogus had went GOD MODE.
He grabbed the first crewmate and dragged him across the floor. The first crewmate cried in fear, "NOO I HAVE CHILDREN I LOOK AFTER PLEASE DONT DO THIS TO ME!". Amogus gave him an evil smile, "You will be forgotten, forgotten and lonely in the dark. So say your last goodbye.". And before the first crewmate could say anything he sliced him in half with his 12 Inch blade threw him to the waterfall in the cave.
Every crewmate started running for their lives panting because of the massive cave, But so did AMOGUS. He started running in supersonic speeds towards the crewmates and his lover. He cut her in half and threw her to the waterfall.
The crewmates ran in panic and fear. But they could still hear the screams of the crewmate and his lover.
Amogus then took out a machine gun and shot all of the crewmates. He then went to the lake and threw the machine gun to the lake and the crewmates were drowned.
Amogus took out a flamethrower and then proceeded to light the place on fire.
Amogus then took out a grenade launcher and started firing all of the crewmates.
Amogus then took out a knife and used all the bodies as food.
The burning anger in him was not gone yet, he crafted 5 bombs with his feet and started walking towards the crewmate civilization. The burning anger is still inside him. The 6 FINGERS are still locked and his murderous intentions are still pouring out of his fingertips. Amogus is now in the midst of breaking the shackles in the basement, with the malice he has inside him.
And now that he has hidden 5 bombs across the civilization, Amogus is ready to execute his masterplan. Amogus is about to take off and fly into space. He is ready to do as he pleases. Amogus is ready to murder his lover and her children and to set the shacks on fire, AND HE WATCHES THE WHOLE WORLD BLOW UP AND CRUMBLE TO PIECES. Amogus knows he is about to live on and he will be a blackish-grey monster like an alien. And his name will be "A-Mogus" the Dark-Blooded Avenger. Amogus will never be dead. No he will never die. He is finally free. And all the horror he saw was just a shadow. He is finally free.

"I WAS THE AMOGUS"
He dies from lack of oxygen, and while his nervous system was shutting down he gives his last smile and a tear drop in his eye...
